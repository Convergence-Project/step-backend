results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of \u00a375m ($141m) compared with \u00a3125m a year earlier.Rod Eddington, BA\u2019s chief executive, said the results were \\\"respectable\\\" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by \u00a3106m or 47.3%.BA\u2019s profits were still better than market expectation of \u00a359m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.In October, it increased this from \u00a36 to \u00a310 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from \u00a32.50 to \u00a34 a leg.Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA\u2019s estimated annual surcharge revenues - \u00a3160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra \u00a3250m.Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to \u00a31.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue.Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA _____ that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers.However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast.\\\"For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,\\\" BA chairman Martin Broughton said.BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.It also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January.Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA\u2019s latest quarterly results as \\\"pretty modest\\\".\\\"It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,\\\" he said.Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive.\\\"Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products,\\\" Mr Eddington said.\\\"For example, we have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds.\\\"BA\u2019s shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.\", \"view1\": \"stated\", \"view2\": \"warned\", \"view3\": \"estimated\", \"view4\": \"indicated\", \"view5\": \"reported\", \"answer\": 2, \"commentary\": \"\ubcf8\ubb38 :  \uc601\uad6d

                                        "    \"main\": \" The dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.And Alan Greenspan highlighted the US government\\u2019s willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it.In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday.Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months.On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan\\u2019s speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data.\\\"I think the chairman\\u2019s taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he\\u2019s taken for some time,\\\" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York.\\\"He\\u2019s taking a _____ view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\\\"Worries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain.China\\u2019s currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency\\u2019s sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive.But calls for a shift in Beijing\\u2019s policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the \\\"time is ripe\\\" for a loosening of the peg.The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy.In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve\\u2019s decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates.The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar.The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US\\u2019s yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments.The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.\",\n" +
