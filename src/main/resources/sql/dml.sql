However, language offers something more valuable than mere information exchange. Because the meanings of words are not invariable and because understanding always involves interpretation, the act of communicating is always a joint, creative effort. Words can carry meanings beyond those consciously intended by speakers or writers because listeners or readers bring their own perspectives to the language they encounter. Ideas expressed imprecisely may be more intellectually stimulating for listeners or readers than simple facts. The fact that language is not always reliable for causing precise meanings to be generated in someone else’s mind is a reflection of its powerful strength as a medium for creating new understanding. It is the inherent ambiguity and adaptability of language as a meaning-making system that makes the relationship between language and thinking so special.',4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?','title','Erase Ambiguity in Language Production!','Not Creative but Simple: The Way Language Works','Communication as a Universal Goal in Language Use','What in Language Creates Varied Understanding?','Language: A Crystal-Clear Looking Glass'),

Historical insight  is not a matter of a continuous “narrowing down” of previous  options, not of an approximation of the truth, but, on the  contrary, is an “explosion” of possible points of view. It  therefore aims at the unmasking of previous illusions of  determinacy and precision by the production of new and  alternative representations, rather than at achieving truth by  a careful analysis of what was right and wrong in those  previous representations.

Cells that help your hand muscles  reach out to an object need to know the size and location of  the object, but they don’t need to know about color. They need  to know a little about shape, but not in great detail. Cells that  help you recognize people’s faces need to be extremely  sensitive to details of shape, but they can pay less attention to  location. It is natural to assume that anyone who sees an object  sees everything about it ― the shape, color, location, and  movement. However, one part of your brain sees its shape,  another sees color, another detects location, and another  perceives movement. Consequently, after localized brain  damage, it is possible to see certain aspects of an object and  not others. Centuries ago, people found it difficult to imagine how someone could see an object without seeing what color it  is. Even today, you might find it surprising to learn about  people who see an object without seeing where it is, or see it  without seeing whether it is moving.',5,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?','title','Visual Systems Never Betray Our Trust!','Secret Missions of Color-Sensitive Brain Cells','Blind Spots: What Is Still Unknown About the Brain','Why Brain Cells Exemplify Nature’s Recovery Process','Separate and Independent: Brain Cells’ Visual Perceptions'),

For example, algorithms have proved more accurate than  humans in predicting whether a prisoner released on parole  will go on to commit another crime, or in predicting whether  a potential candidate will perform well in a job in future. In  over 100 studies across many different domains, half of all  cases show simple formulas make better significant  predictions than human experts, and the remainder (except a  very small handful), show a tie between the two. When there  are a lot of different factors involved and a situation is very uncertain, simple formulas can win out by focusing on the  most important factors and being consistent, while human  judgement is too easily influenced by particularly salient and  perhaps irrelevant considerations. A similar idea is  supported by further evidence that ‘checklists’ can improve  the quality of expert decisions in a range of domains by  ensuring that important steps or considerations aren’t missed  when people are feeling relaxed. For example, treating  patients in intensive care can require hundreds of small  actions per day, and one small error could cost a life. Using  checklists to ensure that no crucial steps are missed has  proved to be remarkably effective in a range of medical  contexts, from preventing live infections to reducing  pneumonia.',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?','title','The Power of Simple Formulas in Decision Making','Always Prioritise: Tips for Managing Big Data','Algorithms’ Mistakes: The Myth of Simplicity','Be Prepared!
